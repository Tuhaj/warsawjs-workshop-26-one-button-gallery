# One button photo gallery

### for WarsawJS Workshop #26 but for everyone too!

The idea of this gallery is to make the whole code maximally simple 
and easy to understand.
Deliberately there is only one file, so the whole code can
be seen and understood by step-by-step development.
I didn't use `const` because explaining it goes too much 
into detail and might be overwhelming for some beginner learners.

The half part of the 8 hour workshop we had was about developing this
and it was more than enough. Might be actually a whole workshop 
only for this. Understanding this for beginners is really diffcult so 
if you have ideas how to skip the `forEach` loop or making the code
even more simple let me know. 

It would be helpful if you attached a list of all thigs to know to write
such gallery. 

Thank you for reading!
